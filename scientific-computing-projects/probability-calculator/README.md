# Probability Calculator

Simulates random draws from a hat and estimates probabilities using repeated experiments.

## Features
- Hat class for ball draws
- Randomized sampling with `random`
- Probability estimation using simulation

## Usage
```python
hat = Hat(red=3, blue=2)
probability = experiment(hat, {"red": 2}, num_balls_drawn=4, num_experiments=1000)
```

## Skills Demonstrated
- Probability and statistics
- Randomization
- Deep copies and simulation
