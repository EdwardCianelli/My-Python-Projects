# 🐍 My Python Projects

Welcome! This repository contains my personal collection of Python projects — starting from foundational exercises and certifications to practical tools and utilities for real-world tasks like log parsing and cybersecurity.

## 📘 What's Inside

This repo documents my journey through Python, from learning the basics to applying it in security and automation use cases.

### ✅ Learning Foundations
- Projects from the **[freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)** certification.
- Includes basic programming, data structures, and algorithmic problem-solving.

### 🔐 Security & Automation
- Python scripts for **log analysis** and **log parsing**.
- Work related to cybersecurity concepts (e.g., event log parsing using `.evtx`, regex filters, automation tasks).
- Tools built for **SOC analyst workflows** and data inspection.

### 🛠️ Tools & Utilities(Coming soon)
- CLI tools
- JSON and CSV parsers
- File system automation and reporting scripts
